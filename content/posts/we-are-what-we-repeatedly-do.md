# Summary

This post accompanies my one-hour presentation to the Riverside County Bar Association on June 30, 2020, _We Are What We Repeatedly Do_. It covers California evidence law on character evidence, other acts evidence, and character impeachment. Where practical, I try to discuss the Federal Rules of Evidence. The law cited here is current as of June 30, 2020.

# The Paradox of Patterns

People [frequently credit Aristotle](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk0029ViTkzgVZkmEOqBormtcdQQNJg%3A1593524169031&ei=yT_7XsW1AZy70PEPg6CAmAg&q=aristotle+quote+we+are+what+we+repeatedly+do&oq=aristotle+quote+we+are+what+we+repeatedly+do&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAA6BwgjELADECc6BwgjELACECdQuklYw01g709oAXAAeACAAWKIAbgEkgEBNpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiFvqSQ1KnqAhWcHTQIHQMQAIMQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) with the quote, "We are what we repeatedly do."
Apparently, Aristotle [did not](http://blogs.umb.edu/quoteunquote/2012/05/08/its-a-much-more-effective-quotation-to-attribute-it-to-aristotle-rather-than-to-will-durant/#:~:text=After%20quoting%20a%20phrase%20from,quotes%20again%20from%20Aristotle's%20work.) [write that](https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/26/fact-check-aristotle-excellence-habit-repeatedly-do/).
American Philosopher Will Durant [did](https://medium.com/the-mission/my-favourite-quote-of-all-time-is-a-misattribution-66356f22843d) while interpreting Aristotle's work.

Misattributions aside, Durant's English distillation of Aristostle's writing reveals a common belief about people's behavior.

- Once a thief, always a thief.
- He did it before; he'll do it again.
- The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.

I couldn't find original sources for these common sayings, but I could find the pattern.
(Well, I did find [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/drphil/status/448127140555268096?lang=en) from Dr. Phil,
but I doubt that 2014 was the first time a psychologist made the observation that past behavior = future behavior.)
Perhaps the reason I couldn't track down original authors for these quotes is because these ideas have been around for so long.

I don't have the psychological expertise or research experience to weigh in on whether these sayings are true or not.
There [seems to be some debate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-predictor-future-behaviour-past-except-joshua-wood).
Fortunately, character evidence analysis doesn't require _validation_ of these notions.
Character evidence analysis requires only an understanding that many people believe
that we are what we repeatedly do and that the laws of evidence (including the California Evidence Code and Federal Rules of Evidence)
seek to prevent the factfinder from relying on that notion.

# Goals

In this post, I hope to help the reader understand a few key concepts:

1. Character evidence concerns Propensity (a Pattern of behavior)
1. Character evidence can take three forms: Conduct, Opinion, and Reputation (COR).
1. COR becomes character evidence _only_ when offered to prove Propensity.
1. COR does not become character evidence when offered to prove Something Else.

**CORPSE**: Is the evidence Conduct, Opinion, or Reputation offered to prove Propensity or Something Else?

## COD and COW

1. Character evidence is admissible to establish a Claim Or Defense (**COD**).
1. Characted evidence is admissible to attack or defend the Credibility of a Witness (**COW**).

## Civil v. Criminal

1. Except for COD and COW, character evidence is almost never admissible in civil cases.
2. In criminal cases, character evidence about the defendant and alleged victim are frequently admissible.

# Patterns and Propensity

Before we get

# Evidence

Evid. Code, § 140

“Evidence” means testimony, writings, material objects, or other **things** presented to the senses that are **offered to prove** the existence or nonexistence of **a fact**.
